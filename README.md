# Sequelize 

### Overview

Created a burger bar with Sequelize, Node, Express, Handlebars. Followed the MVC design pattern; used Node and Seequelize to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

* Burger Bar is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be eaten.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Eat Now` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every burger in a database, whether eaten or not.
